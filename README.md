# Scott Menor's Platform
dated: 29 October, 2017

## Preamble
I believe it is our duty and responsibility to act as stewards. We must ensure that the things we have endure for future generations. We should do whatever we can to ensure that we leave the world better than we found it.

This is the heart of what guides me and my team. It is the reason we are doing this - even though it's hard, and trying, and even though it means we have to do things we don't want to. We will work hard and make tough sacrifices. We will do the right things even though they are not expedient.

I believe that the American experiment of representative democracy is worth preserving. While it is not perfect, it has shown enormous potential - not always realized, but, it does not take a great breadth or depth of knowledge of our history to see what we can accomplish in the moments when we come together for the greater good.

It is critical that we invest in our future. There are so many things that matter - improving education, protecting our environment, funding basic research. The return on these investments may not come tomorrow, but history has shown that it will come and its value will be greater than we can imagine.

Many things are required to protect and nurture our democracy. An educated citizenry is at the foundation. Education is essential - not simply because it may help us earn more money, but because it will enrich our lives in ways that we can't imagine.

Money is great but it is not the end-all be-all of our existence. There are other things that matter more. At its essence, money has no intrinsic value unto itself. Its only real worth stems from the things it enables us to do that actually have value. The blind accumulation of money and its use to distort our government is a disease of the very soul of our country. This must be treated or it will destroy us.

So long as we are willing and able to work, we should all have the opportunity to succeed and to thrive. We should be able to provide for our families. We are a wealthy, enlightened nation. None among us should be forced to live on the streets or suffer needlessly. None of us should die for want of basic medical care. None of our families should be financially devastated because of a tragic accident or illness.

Honor matters. Our words matter. The truth matters.

Good people can make mistakes, but when we do, we must face them, accept responsibility, and learn from them to ensure that we do not repeat them.

When our elected officials - our President, our representatives in Congress, our Governors, and Mayors, and state and local legislators speak, they speak with our collective voice. We must not allow that voice to be used in vain. We have a sacred duty both to our nation's founders, and to our progeny that we pick well.

Our government comes from us. If it does not work, it is our failing. It is true that money and deception exert an outsized influence, however it is only through our laziness and indifference that they are allowed to do so.

We have the power. It is in our hands. What we choose to do with it matters and the loss will not only be our own if we fail.

I am a liberal. That is not a bad word. It simply means that I believe in liberty and equality - in freedom, and equal opportunities.

I am a conservative. That is not a bad word. It simply means that I believe there are things that are worth preserving.

I am a libertarian. That is not a bad word. It simply means that I believe in protecting everyone's freedom so long as it does not infringe upon another's.

I am a progressive. That is not a bad word. It simply means that we should work to improve things for ourselves and others.

I am a socialist. That is not a bad word. It simply means that government has a key role in things like healthcare and a strong social safety net.

I am a capitalist. That is not a bad word. It simply means that private ownership and free enterprise are engines that drive our economy.

You may think these things are in conflict. You are wrong. Each complements the others. For that reason, I am an independent. That is not a bad word. It simply means that I apply a core set of principles to each decision and arrive at my own conclusions without being a member of a particular team, and without being invested in particular paths to achieve common goals.

For all of our differences, we share so much in common. All it takes is free and open discussion to find those things, and once we do, the will to determine the best course of action to achieve them and the desire and wherewithal to follow through.

These are my core values.

They guide me and I do my best to follow them.

I think they are good.

I hope you share them too.

## Education
Our first duty to the future is to educate. We must share the things we have learned in life. We were afforded great opportunities by our predecessors and we must not let those go to waste. As I write this, our population is about seven and a half billion. Over our history, there have been on the order of a hundred billion people born. Conservatively assuming a average lifespan of only 30 years, that is over 200 times the age of our Universe worth of human experiences.

Everything we have and everything we do is built atop that. It is criminal and a great sign of disrespect not to learn and share as much as we can.

### Arts and the Humanities
It is easy to focus on learning the things that we think will pay us back financially. This is blind.

Architecture, art, poetry, music, etc. are all things that enrich our lives greatly. It is a sign that something is wrong with our society that the people who devote their lives focusing on these endeavors are not rewarded commensurately. We should do all that we can to rectify that unless we want to live in a bland world without style or beauty.

We may not all be interested in pursuing any of these as our primary focus, but all of us can benefit from tasting a bit of many forms creativity. Without trying, we can never know how much what we want to do later in life might benefit from what we might have learned.

### Civics
An understanding of civics is fundamental to fulfilling our duty and responsibility as citizens to be well informed and active participants in our government. For that reason, we must ensure that civics are taught as a core part of education at all levels. We must all understand how our government works, and how to operate the various knobs and levers that influence it.

One of my primary goals as a citizen, candidate, and future congressperson, is to educate and inform as many as possible about civics, and why it matters.

### Critical Thinking
If we are unable to think critically, we are susceptible to the whims of con artists and liars. Training students in the art of critical thinking and genuine skepticism is a crucial element in inoculating them against falling for the dishonest and the misguided. Nobody can fool us as easily as we can fool ourselves. For these reasons, we must see to it that wherever possible in every subject there is an emphasis on understanding and escaping logical fallacies, and our own biases.

### History
If we do not study history, we can not learn from it.

### Technology, Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
As Arthur C Clarke said, «Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic». If we wish to be practitioners of such magic, we must understand the various incantations that make it happen. We must learn about the scientific method, and how it successively leads us to ever better understanding of our Universe. We must learn the language of mathematics, and how to apply these things to make new systems using all of our knowledge.

Just as with the arts, it is essential that we all have at least a cursory understanding of these things if we want to be active participants in the refinement of what we have and the creation of new things to improve our future.

## Environment
We all drink the same water and breathe the same air. It is not «the environment», but «our environment». We live in it and if we wish to ensure our own survival and comfort, and those of our descendants, we must do what we can to protect our environment.

Because of the success of progress and the EPA, people have forgotten

## Healthcare


## Fiscal Responsibility
As stewards

## Research and Investing in our future


## Truth and Honesty
These are core values that matter.

## Focus on goals not paths
I'm consistently surprised in talking with people of all political stripes to learn how many things we agree on.

That isn't to say we don't have fundamental differences, but remarkably most of our differences seem to lie in how we can best achieve things, not what those things should be.

As a scientist and engineer, this has always seemed peculiar to me because the hows are implementation details that can be studied and tested, and so long as they are consistent with our morals and ethics, they should not be subject to our tastes.
