# My Platform
dated: 3 November, 2017

## Preamble
It is our duty and responsibility to act as stewards. We must do whatever we can to ensure that we leave the world better to ensure that the good things we have endure.

The American experiment of representative democracy is worth preserving. It is easy to see what we can accomplish in the moments when we come together.

It is critical we invest in the future. Improving education, protecting our environment, and funding basic research have unimaginable return, but it may not come tomorrow.

An educated citizenry is required to protect and nurture our democracy. Education is essential because it will enrich our lives in ways that we can't imagine and it will  help us become better stewards of the future.

Honor matters. What's said matters. The truth matters.

Good people can make mistakes, but when we do, we must face them, accept responsibility, and learn from them.

When our elected officials speak, they speak with our collective voice. We must not allow that voice to speak badly or to be used in vain.


We have the power. It is in our hands. What we choose to do with it matters and the loss will not be ours alone if we fail.

Liberal is not a bad word. It indicates a belief in liberty and equality - in freedom, and equal opportunities.

Conservative is not a bad word. It indicates a belief that there are things that are worth preserving.

Libertarian is not a bad word. It indicates a belief in protecting everyone's freedom so long as it does not infringe upon another's.

Progressive is not a bad word. It indicates a belief that we should work to improve things.

Socialist is not a bad word. It indicates a belief providing healthcare and building a social safety net can be helped by government.

Capitalist is not a bad word. It indicates a belief that private ownership and free enterprise are engines that drive our economy. They should be nurtured for our collective and individual good.

You may think these things are in conflict. You would be wrong. Each complements the others. For that reason, I am an independent. That is not a bad word. It simply means that I believe in a core set of principles  that are applied to each decision and arrive at my own conclusions.

For all of our differences, we share so much in common. All it takes is free and open discussion to find those things, and once we do, the will to determine the best course of action to achieve them and the desire to follow through.

These are my core values.



## Education
Our primary duty to the future is to educate. We must share that which we have learned with the next generation. We were afforded great opportunities by our predecessors and we must not let those go to waste. 

Everything we have, and everything we do is built upon those foundations. It is criminal and disrespectful not to learn and share as much as we can.

## Environment
We all drink the same water and breathe the same air. It is not "_the environment_", but "_our environment_". We live in it and if we wish to ensure our own survival and comfort, and those of our descendants, we must do what we can to protect our environment.

## Fiscal Responsibility
I believe in spending the monies that we have, and only using loans against the future if we have to for reasons and stuff.

## Healthcare
Healthcare needs to be decoupled from employment. Although it may be possible for Americans to get the best care in the world, we spend more and get less than almost any other first world country. It is our duty to ourselves, our friends, our families, and our futures that we fix that. 

## Immigration
I will work to ensure that we keep the spring of creativity filled with people who are wanting to fulfill the American dream.

We are a nation of immigrants.

It is what defines us and regular replenishing of our populous with new blood is one of our greatest sources of strength. That is not to say that our borders should be completely open, but our continued strength as a nation and our very survival is dependent on making it possible for people who believe in the American dream to come here and become citizens.

## Personal Responsibility
It is better for all when we share some of our wealth with our communities to do things collectively. Our government should be as nimble and efficient as possible without compromising its function, and we should be free to build individual and generational wealth, however we must also work to ensure that every member of every generation has the same chance at a fulfilling life/.

Personal success and profit are good, but these things must not come at the expense of others' ability to subsist. The desire to enrich ourselves and our families is a big part of what makes capitalism work, but it is obscene to gluttonously gorge ourselves. Entrepreneurs and CEOs contribute an outsized amount of value and deserve outsized compensation for that so long as they are treating their employees fairly.


## Marriage Equality
I strongly support freedom and equity. You are free to believe whatever you like, and to act accordingly within your own life - up to the point where your freedom begins to impose upon others'. Nobody has a right to impose their religious beliefs on others, and we should all be happy and support people when they have found a partner, are happy, and want to celebrate and formalize their union, and to adopt children when they are willing and able.

## Research and Infrastructure
In order to ensure the fiscal and technological wellbeing of our descendants, it is crucial that we invest in basic and applied research, and in hard and soft infrastructure. 

## Service and Veterans
We all have a duty to engage in some form of service where we can. That service can be in the form of volunteering, taking an active part in civics, or in the military. When people use their life in service to our country, we have a responsibility to remember what they did for us and to help them when they need it.

## Small Business
We support making it easier for more people to strike out and take chances. Today, it is extremely dangerous if not practically impossible for most people to start a business because of the capital requirements, and the difficulty of ensuring that they and their families will be protected if they get sick or injured. This is one reason why universal healthcare is essential. It unties people's hands and makes it possible for them to leave bad jobs and take risks by starting new businesses. (This should maybe be moved to healthcare)

## Truth and Honesty
These are core values that matter, and we must hold one another accountable. Intentionally being dishonest is not acceptable and should not be tolerated. Lying and deception are contrary to the goal of preserving our democracy. I will work to ensure that all the lies that I come across will be shown the light of day.

## Unions
The successes of organized labor and collective bargaining has made us forget their necessity. There muse be a balance between the rights of businesses and the rights of workers. We must protect people's right to organize and bargain collectively in order to ensure the ongoing health and sustainability of the middle class.

## Focus on goals not paths
It's consistently surprising how people of all political stripes agree on the majority of topics.

That isn't to say people don't have fundamental differences, but remarkably most of our differences seem to lie in how goals are best achieved, not what those goals should be.


## Conclusions
This is a living document and is intended only as a guide and to set the tone. It is far from comprehensive, but it should contain enough information for you to make informed judgements from, and it should, in broad strokes, show you who I am, what I believe in, and what motivated me to enter politics.

I believe in the American ideals of applying ourselves and building something from nothing. We should be the good guys. Even when it's hard and we are tempted to take the easy path, we should do the right things. We should stand up and lead the world. That means taking a good, long, honest look at ourselves, seeing where we need to improve, and digging in to do what we must to get to where we need to be.

Thank you very much.

If you have any suggestions to improve it, they are welcome.


=============

From here down is stuff that I removed.  It is staying in this mid-change version of the document because some of things had been reworded or reorganized. (Seriously, let's call STEM STEM and order educational stuff my its importance.)



Money is not the end-all be-all of our existence. There are other things that matter more. At its essence, money has no intrinsic value. Its only real worth stems from the things it enables us to do that have real value. The blind accumulation of money and its use to distort our government is a disease of the very soul of our country. This must be treated or it will destroy us. I will work to treat this by doing X, trying Y, and tasting Z. 

We should be able to provide for ourselves and our families. We are a wealthy, enlightened nation. None among us should be forced to live on the streets or suffer needlessly. None of us should die for want of basic medical care. None of our families should be financially devastated because of a tragic accident or illness. A basic sustainable income is something that I will fight for. 




Our government comes from us. If it does not work, it is our failing. It is true that money and deception exert an outsized influence, however it is only through our laziness and indifference that they are allowed to do so.












### Critical Thinking
If we are unable to think critically, we are susceptible to the whims of con artists and liars. Training students in the art of critical thinking and genuine skepticism is a crucial element in inoculating them against falling for the dishonest and the misguided. Nobody can fool us as easily as we can fool ourselves. For these reasons, we must see to it that wherever possible in every subject there is an emphasis on understanding and escaping logical fallacies, and our own biases.

### Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
As Arthur C Clarke said, «Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic». If we wish to be practitioners of such magic, we must understand the various incantations that make it happen. We must learn about the scientific method, and how it successively leads us to ever better understanding of our Universe. We must learn the language of mathematics, and how to apply these things to make new systems using all of our knowledge.

### Civics
An understanding of civics is fundamental to fulfilling our duty and responsibility as citizens to be well informed and active participants in our government. For that reason, we must ensure that civics are taught as a core part of education at all levels. We must all understand how our government works, and how to operate the various knobs and levers that influence it.

One of my primary goals as a citizen, candidate, and future congressperson, is to educate and inform as many as possible about civics, and why it matters.

### History
If we do not study history, we can not learn from it. It is easy to reduce history to facts and dates, but what matters are the stories and experiences - these are the things we can learn the most from. What worked and why. What didn't work and why not. How have things changed and how have they stayed the same? The wealth of knowledge locked in our history is almost incalculable, and it is incumbent upon us to mine it and to share it with the next generation.
