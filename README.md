# Scott Menor's Platform
dated: 29 October, 2017

## Preamble
I believe it is our duty and responsibility to act as stewards. We must ensure that the things we have endure for future generations. We should do whatever we can to ensure that we leave the world better than we found it.

This is the heart of what guides me and my team. It is the reason we are doing this - even though it's hard, and trying, and even though it means we have to do things we don't want to. We will work hard and make tough sacrifices. We will do the right things even though they are not expedient.

I believe that the American experiment of representative democracy is worth preserving. While it is not perfect, it has shown enormous potential - not always realized, but, it does not take a great breadth or depth of knowledge of our history to see what we can accomplish in the moments when we come together for the greater good.

It is critical that we invest in our future. There are so many things that matter - improving education, protecting our environment, funding basic research. The return on these investments may not come tomorrow, but history has shown that it will come and its value will be greater than we can imagine.

Many things are required to protect and nurture our democracy. An educated citizenry is at the foundation. Education is essential - not simply because it may help us earn more money, but because it will enrich our lives in ways that we can't imagine.

Money is great but it is not the end-all be-all of our existence. There are other things that matter more. At its essence, money has no intrinsic value unto itself. Its only real worth stems from the things it enables us to do that actually have value. The blind accumulation of money and its use to distort our government is a disease of the very soul of our country. This must be treated or it will destroy us.

So long as we are willing and able to work, we should all have the opportunity to succeed and to thrive. We should be able to provide for our families. We are a wealthy, enlightened nation. None among us should be forced to live on the streets or suffer needlessly. None of us should die for want of basic medical care. None of our families should be financially devastated because of a tragic accident or illness.

Honor matters. Our words matter. The truth matters.

Good people can make mistakes, but when we do, we must face them, accept responsibility, and learn from them to ensure that we do not repeat them.

When our elected officials - our President, our representatives in Congress, our Governors, and Mayors, and state and local legislators speak, they speak with our collective voice. We must not allow that voice to be used in vain. We have a sacred duty both to our nation's founders, and to our progeny that we pick well.

These are my core values.

They guide me and I do my best to follow them.

I think they are good.

I hope you share them too.










## Civics
We all have a duty and responsibility as citizens to be well informed and active participants in our government.

At the most fundamental level, that means that we have to understand how our government works.

One of my primary goals as a citizen, candidate, and future congressperson is to educate and inform people about how our government works, what is happening within it, and the impact that will make on our lives.

### Education
For our representative democracy to work, civics and critical thinking must be a required part of early education.

It is essential that we all know how our government works, what levers are available to us to influence it, and how to operate them.

It is also essential that everyone be educated and well versed in critical thinking skills so we are less susceptible to influence by dishonest people.

### Participation
Anyone who wants to have a voice in our government should have a fair opportunity to do so.

Politicians are civil servants and stewards. They must not be for sale, and a core part of their job is to cultivate the next generation of leaders and ensure the continued survival of our precious democracy.

## Focus on goals not paths
I'm consistently surprised in talking with people of all political stripes to learn how many things we agree on.

That isn't to say we don't have fundamental differences, but remarkably most of our differences seem to lie in how we can best achieve things, not what those things should be.

As a scientist and engineer, this has always seemed peculiar to me because the hows are implementation details that can be studied and tested, and so long as they are consistent with our morals and ethics, they should not be subject to our tastes.
