## Civics
We all have a duty and responsibility as citizens to be well informed and active participants in our government.

At the most fundamental level, that means that we have to understand how our government works.

One of my primary goals as a citizen, candidate, and future congressperson is to educate and inform people about how our government works, what is happening within it, and the impact that will make on our lives.

### Education
For our representative democracy to work, civics and critical thinking must be a required part of early education.

It is essential that we all know how our government works, what levers are available to us to influence it, and how to operate them.

It is also essential that everyone be educated and well versed in critical thinking skills so we are less susceptible to influence by dishonest people.
