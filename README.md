## Civics
We all have a duty and responsibility as citizens to be well informed and active participants in our government.

At the most fundamental level, that means that we have to understand how our government works.

One of my primary goals as a citizen, candidate, and future congressperson is to educate and inform people about how our government works, what is happening within it, and the impact that will make on our lives.

### Education
For our representative democracy to work, civics and critical thinking must be a required part of early education.

It is essential that we all know how our government works, what levers are available to us to influence it, and how to operate them.

It is also essential that everyone be educated and well versed in critical thinking skills so we are less susceptible to influence by dishonest people.

### Participation
Anyone who wants to have a voice in our government should have a fair opportunity to do so.

## Focus on goals not paths
I'm consistently surprised in talking with people of all political stripes to learn how many things we agree on.

That isn't to say we don't have fundamental differences, but remarkably most of our differences seem to lie in how we can best achieve things, not what those things should be.

As a scientist and engineer, this has always seemed peculiar to me because the hows are implementation details that can be studied and tested, and so long as they are consistent with our morals and ethics, they should not be subject to our tastes.
